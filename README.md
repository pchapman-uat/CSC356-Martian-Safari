- Navigation menu
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Data retrieved from MySQL DB and displayed on at least 1 PHP web page
- Implement a Testing strategy involving reliability, accuracy, and UI testing. Demonstrate the testing strategy with screenshots or a video.
- The application should not be something just to demonstrate the requirements; it should "do" something.
